            Argentine world traveler, writer, journalist and fashion producer
            My professional career in the fashion world began in 2013 and since then I have been incorporating different visual and written techniques.
            As a fashion producer, my aim is to create an image. I work with the client, either a brand or an individual, from the main concept and try to implement what they have in mind. My job is to bring any idea, no matter how crazy it seems, to life. I take care of every step, from the research of the perfect photographer to the scouting of models, including the seeking of a studio, or an outdoor or inside location.

            As a writer and a fashion journalist, I dedicated last years to hold different meetings with leading figures of the fashion and art worlds. Through my research, I have found artists with new visions of the world, and messages to transmit that may reach the reader in a more personal and emotional way. Thus, I try to make people see fashion not as a final product, but as a creative process.
            Both careers have given me the opportunity to develop my most creative and revolutionary side when it comes to talking about fashion. Thanks to various interviews and meetings with professionals, I arrived at the conclusion that there is a personal process given at an exact moment in the career of each artist that leads us to fashion, seen from different perspectives. We only need to have the ability to visualize it.
